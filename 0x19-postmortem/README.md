# Postmortem Report: Web Stack Debugging Incident
Incident Summary:
Date: 20th August, 2024
Duration: 8 hours
Severity: High
Affected Systems: Frontend, Backend, Database
Root Cause: Misconfiguration in the API gateway and outdated dependencies.
## Incident Overview:
The web stack debugging incident began when several critical web services started to fail across the platform. Users experienced timeouts, broken pages, and inconsistencies in data fetching. The debugging process uncovered a multi-layered issue affecting the frontend, backend, and database interaction.

## Timeline of Events:
[Time T1]: First error reports from users. Frontend pages returning 500 errors.
[Time T2]: Initial investigation into the frontend revealed that API calls to the backend were not responding.
[Time T3]: Backend logs showed frequent timeout errors when querying the database.
[Time T4]: API gateway misconfiguration identified, causing request timeouts.
[Time T5]: Further investigation revealed outdated libraries causing dependency conflicts.
[Time T6]: Issue isolated to improper API gateway routing rules and stale caching.
[Time T7]: API gateway configuration corrected, dependency libraries updated.
[Time T8]: Services gradually restored.
[Time T9]: Monitoring and testing confirmed stable operation across the web stack.
### Root Cause Analysis:
API Gateway Misconfiguration:
The primary issue was traced to a recent change in the API gateway configuration. Incorrect routing rules caused some backend services to be unreachable, resulting in failed API requests.

### Outdated Dependencies:
Several backend dependencies had not been updated in recent releases, leading to compatibility issues and intermittent failures in database communication.

### Stale Cache:
Caching issues were also identified, as outdated routing rules were still being used, causing inconsistencies in the responses being returned to the frontend.

### Resolution:
API Gateway Configuration Fix:
Corrected routing rules in the API gateway, ensuring proper communication between the frontend and backend services.

### Dependency Updates:
Updated all outdated libraries and dependencies in the backend services, ensuring compatibility with the latest database version.

### Cache Purge and Reset:
Cleared and reset the cache to ensure that correct API routes and configurations were in place.

## Lessons Learned:
Improve Testing and Monitoring:
More rigorous testing of configuration changes to the API gateway is required. Automated tests should validate critical routing rules before deployment.
Dependency Management:
Regular audits of system dependencies are necessary to prevent issues caused by outdated libraries.
Faster Communication and Collaboration:
Early cross-team communication could have expedited the identification of the root cause. A more structured incident management process should be in place to bring teams together for critical debugging sessions.
Action Items:
Automated Tests for API Gateway:

Implement a suite of automated tests for validating API gateway configurations to prevent misconfigurations in future updates.
Dependency Management Process:

Establish a formal process for periodically reviewing and updating backend dependencies.
Improved Incident Response:

Set up clearer incident management protocols to involve relevant teams early in the debugging process.
Monitoring and Alerting Improvements:

Enhance monitoring tools to provide earlier and more detailed alerts for issues related to API gateway routing and backend dependencies.
